# Overview

This project showcases the implementation of three fundamental optimization algorithms used in machine learning from scratch: Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. The goal of this project is to provide a deep understanding of these techniques by building them step-by-step using Python.

#Introduction

Gradient descent algorithms are essential for optimizing machine learning models. This project provides:

* A conceptual overview and mathematical formulation of each algorithm.
* Practical Python implementations with detailed code explanations.
* Comparative analysis of the performance and efficiency of each method.

# Gradient Descent
Conceptual Overview
Gradient Descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a function. It is widely used in machine learning to optimize the cost function of models.

## Implementation
* Mathematical Formulation: Detailed derivation and explanation.
* Python Code: Step-by-step implementation illustrating the process of minimizing a cost function.

# Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Understanding SGD
Stochastic Gradient Descent is a variant of gradient descent where the gradient is estimated using a randomly selected subset of data. This method provides faster convergence on large datasets.

## Implementation
* Theoretical Explanation: How SGD differs from traditional gradient descent and its practical benefits.
* Python Code: Demonstration of the stochastic nature of SGD with code examples.
* Performance Analysis: Scenarios where SGD outperforms other methods.

# Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

Combining Approaches
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent integrates the advantages of both batch and stochastic methods. It splits the dataset into small batches and performs updates on each mini-batch.

## Implementation

* Practical Explanation: How mini-batch gradient descent works with real data.
* Python Code: Implementation showing the process with visualizations.
* Efficiency Evaluation: Comparison with gradient descent and SGD.
